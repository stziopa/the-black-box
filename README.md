# the-black-box
The Black Box is a smart “energy aware” plug which requests carbon-dioxide intensity data from the web and compares it to the day before. If the current CO2 emissions are less than yesterday at the same hour, the power strip connects to the main grid, otherwise no current will flow through.
In order to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions we must rise awareness of the way energy is produced and delivered. How our daily routines would change if we were forced to reduce our energy consumption? How long will it take until we reach the zero and what will be next? 

The project has been developed during the 11th edition of PIF camp (27 July – 2 August 2025) in Soča, Slovenia
